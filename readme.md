## 1. Requirements

The following modules are required.

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Python >=3.5 (`Anaconda3` recommended)
- PyTorch 0.4 (`virtualenv` recommended)
- Cuda 9.0

---

## 2. Execution

### 2.1 HMM Map-matching
Due to privacy protocols, we cannot render the Map-matching part. We try our best to provide the interface of the learned observation and transition probabilities. Moreover, a simple HMM framework is also provided in `src/pymatch.py`.


### 2.2 Training

```bash
$ cd pygcn
$ python gcn_train.py
$ cd trans
$ python trans_train.py
```

### 2.3 Serve

```bash
$ python gcnServer_old.py
$ python transServer.py
```
---

## 3. Map-matching-Example

We provide some figures to illustrate the matching of LHMM in director `Mapmatching-Figures`.

---

## 4. Dataset

We used real trajectory data. Unfortunately, due to privacy protection, we cannot provide the dataset for testing.

---

## 5. License

The code is developed under the MPL-02.0 license.
